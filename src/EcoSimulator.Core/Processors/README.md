# Processors

This directory contains the system's data processing and manipulation logic. Processors are responsible for executing business rules and necessary transformations on entities (such as `Organisms`).

## Overview

The `processors` module is designed to keep logic separate from data representation, thus facilitating project maintenance, scalability, and unit testing.

## Structure

The package includes the following main components:

*   **Core Processors**: Handle the main logic flow.
*   **Helpers**: Auxiliary functions for specific calculations.
*   **Validators**: Ensure data integrity before processing.
